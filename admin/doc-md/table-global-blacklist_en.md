If one of these phrases/terms is contained in a log line, then the log entry is ignored by this adapter, regardless of what is set in the parser rules (filter). Both string and regex are allowed. If string: it is checked for partial match, i.e. if you enter e.g. "echo", then every log line containing "echo" will be filtered out, also e.g. "Command sent to echo in kitchen".
Please place regex between `/` and `/`, so that the adapter recognizes if it is a regexp.

In the column "Comment" you can comment/explain the respective entry as you like, for example so that you can later understand why you have set this blacklist entry.
